                <h3>The Importance of Sleep</h3>
                <p>
                    The importance of sleep extends beyond rest; it impacts our physical, emotional, and mental health.
                    In the article <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/rest-gap-women-tired_l_661835e9e4b011e99abd6a5f" target="_blank">*Is The 'Rest Gap' Why Women Are So Exhausted?*</a> research says women tend to report more sleep trouble in general. Women are conditioned to take care of others before themselves, sacrificing their sleep to keep up with daily demands. Unfortunately, this behavior leads to burnout, affecting our physical, emotional, and mental health. Having healthy sleep habits can improve our overall health and productivity.
